# FourTracks Project Roadmap

## Executive Summary

FourTracks is a web-based 4-track audio recorder designed to provide a professional multitrack recording experience in the browser. Following a failed monolithic approach, this rebuild emphasizes modular architecture with strict file size limits and incremental development. Each phase delivers a working application with new features building upon a solid foundation.

**Key Goals:**
- Sub-10ms audio latency
- Hardware-inspired skeuomorphic UI

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### High Risk
1. **Web Audio Latency**
   - Risk: Cannot achieve <10ms across browsers
   - Mitigation: Start with 50ms target, optimize incrementally
   - Fallback: Document browser-specific limitations

2. **Browser Storage Limits**
   - Risk: Large recordings exceed quotas
   - Mitigation: Implement chunked storage, warn users
   - Fallback: External file management

### Medium Risk
1. **Cross-Browser Audio APIs**
   - Risk: Inconsistent implementations
   - Mitigation: Test early on all major browsers
   - Fallback: Polyfills and feature detection

2. **Performance with 4 Tracks**
   - Risk: Audio glitches under load
   - Mitigation: Efficient buffer management
   - Fallback: Reduce visualization quality

### Low Risk
1. **UI Responsiveness**
   - Risk: Complex controls lag
   - Mitigation: React optimization techniques
   - Fallback: Simplify animations
