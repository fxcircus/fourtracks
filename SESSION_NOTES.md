# FourTracks Development Session Notes

## Session 2025-08-04

### Phase 1 Completion
- **Major Issue Resolved**: Audio recording was producing metallic/robotic sound
- **Root Cause**: AudioWorklet implementation had data corruption issues
- **Solution**: Switched to MediaRecorder API (similar to previous tapeFour project)
- **Key Fix**: AudioEngine was disposing recorder too early, causing chunks to be lost
- **Result**: Clean voice recording now works perfectly

### Technical Details
1. **MediaRecorderWrapper** created to replace AudioBufferRecorder
2. **Audio chain**: MediaRecorder → Blob chunks → ArrayBuffer → AudioBuffer
3. **Fixed timing issue**: Recorder disposal now happens after processing completes
4. **Current recorder priority**: MediaRecorder → AudioWorklet → ScriptProcessor

### Current State
- ✅ Single track recording/playback works
- ✅ Clean audio without artifacts
- ✅ Waveform visualization
- ✅ Transport controls
- ✅ Volume/mute controls
- ✅ Device selection

### Next Steps - Phase 2: Multi-Track Foundation
Need to implement:
1. Expand UI to show 4 tracks
2. Track selection for recording
3. Multi-track playback
4. Track management UI
5. Independent track controls

### Architecture Notes
- AudioEngine already supports multiple tracks (Map structure)
- Each track has independent volume, pan, mute, solo
- Need to update UI components to handle track selection
- Recording currently hardcoded to track 1

### Files to Update for Phase 2
- `AudioRecorder.tsx` - Show 4 tracks instead of 1
- `TrackControls.tsx` - Already exists, need 4 instances
- Create `TrackSelector` component
- Update recording to use selected track
