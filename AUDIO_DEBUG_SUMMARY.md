# Audio Recording Debug Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Comprehensive Logging
- **AudioEngine.ts**: Added detailed console logs throughout the recording chain
- **AudioBufferRecorder.ts**: Added logging for worklet initialization and data processing
- **ScriptProcessorRecorder.ts**: Enhanced with sample value logging and connection debugging
- **AudioNodeManager.ts**: Added connection logging

### 2. Created Device Selection UI
- **DeviceSelector component**: Dropdown for selecting audio input devices
- Automatically enumerates available devices
- Handles device changes dynamically
- Shows device labels when permissions are granted

### 3. Added Visual Recording Feedback
- **RecordingIndicator component**: Shows animated recording status
- **AudioWaveform component**: Real-time waveform visualization during recording
- **Level meter enhancements**: Shows peak/RMS percentages

### 4. Fixed Audio Recording Chain Issues
- Removed audio feedback by not connecting recorder directly to speakers
- Fixed ScriptProcessor fallback (AudioWorklet currently disabled)
- Added monitoring gain node at low volume for audio feedback
- Enhanced buffer processing with audio presence detection

### 5. Created Debug Tools
- **debug-recording.ts**: Standalone test to verify browser audio capabilities
- Debug button in UI to run audio tests
- Detailed logging of audio data flow

## How to Debug

1. **Open Browser Console** (F12)
   - All audio operations are logged with [ComponentName] prefix
   - Look for errors or warnings

2. **Run Debug Test**
   - Click "Debug Audio" button in bottom-right corner
   - This runs a comprehensive test of audio capabilities
   - Make noise during the 3-second test period

3. **Check Console Logs During Recording**
   - Device enumeration logs
   - Media stream details
   - Sample values from recorder
   - Buffer processing results

4. **Common Issues to Check**:
   - **No audio devices**: Check system audio settings
   - **Permission denied**: Clear site permissions and try again
   - **Silent recording**: Check if microphone is muted at OS level
   - **No waveform**: Verify input levels in system audio settings

## What Should Work Now

1. **Device Selection**: Select from available microphones
2. **Visual Feedback**: See recording indicator and waveform
3. **Audio Capture**: ScriptProcessor fallback records audio
4. **Level Monitoring**: Real-time input levels displayed
5. **Debug Info**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

## Next Steps if Still Not Working

1. Check browser console for specific error messages
2. Run the debug test to verify basic audio functionality
3. Verify microphone permissions in browser settings
4. Test with different browsers (Chrome recommended)
5. Check if other web apps can access your microphone
