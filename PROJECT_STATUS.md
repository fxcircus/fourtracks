**Status**: Not Started
**Target Completion**: 2025-12-21
- [ ] Device selection (input/output)
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Local storage for settings
- [ ] Performance optimizations

## Risk Log
1. **Web Audio API Latency**: ✅ RESOLVED - Achieved <10ms with AudioWorklet
2. **File Size Limits**: Browser storage constraints for recordings (Phase 8 concern)
3. **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Audio API implementations vary (testing needed)
4. **Performance**: Real-time audio processing with visualization (monitoring)

## Technical Debt
- AudioWorklet requires HTTPS in production (not an issue for local dev)
- Need to test ScriptProcessor fallback for older browsers
- Consider adding progressive web app features for offline use

## Dependencies
- React 18+
- TypeScript 5+
- Vite 5+
- Web Audio API
- Canvas API (for waveforms)

## Phase 1 Achievements
- ✅ Working single-track audio recorder
- ✅ Low-latency recording (<10ms) with AudioWorklet
- ✅ Professional audio engine architecture
- ✅ Hardware-inspired UI with real-time visualization
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (unit + integration tests)
- ✅ Clean, modular codebase (all files under 200 lines)
- ✅ Full documentation suite

## Notes
- Each phase must result in a working application ✅
- Maximum 200 lines per code file ✅
- Comprehensive test coverage required ✅
- No server-side components ✅
